For this project I went to the publically available government data.  The dataset used was that of all know Meteorites, both those that were discovered after their impact (Found), and those that were observed falling (Fell).

After loading the .csv file data into pandas, I began exploratory data analysis.

I looked to see which years had the greatest total number of meteorites, and which years had the greatest mass.

Sorting the data I generated a map of all known meteorites with a mass greater than 100 kg.

I also generated a map of all known meteorites and differentiated by those that were found and those that fell.
